A prompt is the input provided to a language model, consisting of multiple components and can be parameterized using prompt templates. A prompt template offers a reproducible method for generating prompts, enabling easy customization through input variables.

### PromptTemplate

The `PromptTemplate` component enables users to create prompts and define variables that control how the model is instructed. Users can input a set of variables which the template uses to generate the prompt when a conversation starts.

<Admonition type="info">
  After defining a variable in the prompt template, it acts as its own component
  input. See [Prompt Customization](../administration/prompt-customization) for more details.
