# üñ•Ô∏è Flows, components, collections, and projects

## TL;DR

A [flow](#flow) is a pipeline of components connected together in the Langflow canvas.

A [component](#component) is a single building block within a flow. A component has inputs, outputs, and parameters that define its functionality.

A [collection](#collection) is a snapshot of the flows available in your database. Collections can be downloaded to local storage and uploaded for future use.

A [project](#project) can be a component or a flow. Projects are saved as part of your collection.

For example, the **OpenAI LLM** is a **component** of the **Basic prompting** flow, and the **flow** is stored in a **collection**.
